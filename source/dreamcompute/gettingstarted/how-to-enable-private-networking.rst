What is private networking?
===========================

Private networking is a type of network in which all the servers connected 
to that network are able to talk to each other and reach the rest of the 
internet through a router, but the rest of the internet cannot initialize 
a connection to those servers. 

Private networking is ideal for running services that you wish to make
secure, as these services are unreachable from the internet and thus are
much harder to hack.

Enabling private networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

US-EAST 2 has public networking available by default which means every one of
your servers gets allocated a public IP address when it is created on that
network.

In order to enable private networking on your account in US-EAST 2, you must
contact support and make a request to enable it. Currently, this is unavailable
through the panel.

Price
~~~~~

Private networking in US-EAST 2 costs $5 per private network.
