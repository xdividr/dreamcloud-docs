How to upload an SSH key via the web UI
=======================================

DreamCompute utilizes ssh keys for accessing your instances, instead
of using passwords alone.  This is done for increased security and
simplifies managing users for OpenStack (the public key is injected
into the instance at boot). This prevents needing to modify files or
passwords on the operating system on startup.

SSH keypairs are managed on the Access & Security -> Keypairs
section of the dashboard.

SSH Key Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two parts to an SSH key: a private key and a public key.
The private key is known only to you and should be safeguarded.  On
UNIX-based systems such as Mac and Linux, the private key is generally
stored in:

.. code-block:: bash

    /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa

The public key can be shared with any server that you would like ssh
access to.  Similarly, the public key will be stored in:

.. code-block:: bash

    /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

SSH keys generated on Windows systems using the
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ key
generator (puttygen.exe) are not stored in a uniform location, but
instead where the user chooses to save them.

Create a new SSH key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

via the DreamCompute dashboard
------------------------------

The easiest way to generate a key is to have DreamCompute generate one
for you.  You can do this by going to the DreamCompute dashboard, Access &
Security -> Keypairs.  On the top right, click the "Create Keypair" button,
give the key a name, and click "Create Keypair".  Your browser will start
downloading the private key named the same as they name given with a
.pem file extension.  Save this file for later user as your id_rsa
private key file.

via puttygen.exe
----------------

This program can be downloaded from the
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ website.
After running the program, click on the "generate" button, and follow
the instructions to generate random data.  When complete, you can
click the "save private key" button to save the .ppk (PuTTY Private
Key File) file for use with PuTTY later.  The text at the top labeled
"Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file" can be
copy/pasted into a text file for importing into the DreamCompute
dashboard and other future uses.  The "save public key" button saves a
modified version of the public key that won't directly import into the
DreamCompute dashboard.  Save these files in a safe location.  The
final step is to continue to the Import an Existing section to import
the key into DreamCompute.

Here is an example of the puttygen.exe program:

.. figure:: images/Puttygen.png
    :alt: Putty

via ssh-keygen
--------------

This program can be found on Mac, Linux and other unix-based operating
systems.

When run:

STEP 1: Enter a file name to save private key to (**hit enter for the
recommended default that you see in parenthesis**).

STEP 2: Enter a password (recommended). You can press enter twice to
not have a password.

The output looks like this:

.. code-block:: console

    [user@localhost]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    66:d9:a4:f0:8d:0b:72:93:b8:67:2e:af:f6:91:ce:e3 myuser@mycomputer
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |      .   .      |
    |     . + B       |
    |    o = S o      |
    |     + * .       |
    |    . = .        |
    |    o*..         |
    |   ..*E.         |
    +-----------------+

The final step is to continue to the Import an Existing SSH Key
section to import the key into DreamCompute.

Checking For An Existing Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a Windows system, there isn't an easy way to find where keys were
generated or stored.  A private key generated from puttygen.exe is
saved with the .ppk file extension, but the other files it generates
has no default extension.  You could search your system for .ppk files
and perhaps find your public key in the same location.

On Mac and Linux systems, you can check in the above
described location:

.. code-block:: console

    [user@localhost]$ ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
    /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa  /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Import an Existing SSH key into the Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the public key file, and open it to copy its contents.  Next, go
to the DreamCompute dashboard, go to Access & Security -> Keypairs, and
click on "Import Keypair".  Give it a name and paste in the contents
of your public key, then click "Import Keypair" to save it.
