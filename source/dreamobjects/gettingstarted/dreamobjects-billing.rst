How does DreamObjects Billing Work?
===================================

If you haven't selected a pre-paid plan when your free trial expires, your
account will automatically transition to Usage-Based Billing. Don't sweat it:
that means you'll only pay if you store or transfer files to and from
DreamObjects. If you don’t use DreamObjects, you won't owe a cent!

DreamObjects Pre-Paid Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepaid plans are good if you store a lot of data, like you keep backups or a
lot of live content.

The charge for downloading is 5¢ per GB, but there is no charge for uploading
data to DreamObjects.
