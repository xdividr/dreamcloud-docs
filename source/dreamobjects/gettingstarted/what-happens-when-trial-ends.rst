What happens at the end of DreamObjects free trial
==================================================

DreamObjects provides 100GB of storage and outbound bandwidth free for
30 days. Usage exceeding such trial limits will be charged at
usage-based billing rates described below.

Once the trial expires, you'll be automatically converted to
Usage-Based Billing unless you specifiy a prepaid monthly storage
plan.

You can visualize your storage and bandwidth consumption history on
`DreamHost Control Panel`_ and make your decisions at the end of the
trial period.

Usage-Based Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage-Based Billing means that you're charged only if you store or
download objects. The current price is 2.5¢/GB per month for the data
you store and 5¢/GB per month of download bandwidth (upload or
'Transfer in' bandwidth is free). There’s no per-request charge for
API requests.  Storage and transfer charges still apply when initiated
through the API.

Prepaid plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you store more than a handful of small files that are rarely
downloaded, prepaid plans offer bulk discounts over the usage-based
billing.

If you exceed your plan’s included storage, then it’s just 2.5¢/GB per
month for additional storage.

There are several storage plans available to best match your needs.
After selecting a plan, you’ll prepay the plan price each month. If
you change your mind, you can upgrade the plan at anytime, or
downgrade the plan effective your next billing cycle.

The updated prices of prepaid plans are published on `DreamHost
website`_.

How is my monthly data storage calculated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your total data usage is monitored regularly and stored in the system
as bytes. DreamHost uses the maximum bytes stored during the billing
period, converts that to GB and then multiplied by the appropriate rate.

How is my monthly download bandwidth calculated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download bandwidth is calculated based on metered data transferred out
of DreamObjects. Similar to storage, download bandwidth is stored in
bytes. The aggregate number of bytes downloaded is converted to GB and
then multiplied by the download rate of 5¢ per GB.

There is no charge for uploading data into DreamObjects.

You can check on your usage directly inside the DreamHost Panel on the
`Panel > Cloud Services > DreamObjects > Usage Tab`_ page:
